        <p>I like shopping for clothes and food from different shops. I usually buy shirts, pants, and shoes from clothing stores. For food, I go to nearby grocery shops to buy rice, vegetables, fruits, milk, and snacks. These shops help me get everything I need easily and save my time. Shopping from familiar shops also makes me feel comfortable and happy.</p>
